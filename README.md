# Soultions-of-Starting-out-with-c-programming-challenges
These are the first six chapters solutions which are tested in Visual Studio 2015.
The rest of the chapters will be done soon in the future Inshallah.
The programs are tested in vs studio express 2015 and are checked but as being human there can be a
mistake.Actually starting out with c++ is the excellent book for a begginer to start with.I would
recommend amy begginer to try yourself before jumping to this because coding is only 
practise and if you will copy anothers code you will not become a good developer at all.Thanks
HAPPY CODING!. TAKE CARE
